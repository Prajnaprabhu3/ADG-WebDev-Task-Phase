<div class="grid-item1"><h1>Early life and education</h1>
<p>Batra was born on 9 September 1974, in a small town in Palampur, Himachal Pradesh. He was the third child of Girdhari Lal Batra, a government school principal, and Kamal Kanta Batra, a school teacher. He was the elder of twin sons, and was born fourteen minutes before his brother, named Vishal. The twins were nicknamed: 'Luv' (Vikram) and 'Kush' (Vishal), after the twin sons of the Hindu deity Rama, by their mother who was a professed devotee of Rama.[1] He had two sisters: Seema and Nutan.[2] As a young child, Batra received his primary education under the tutelage of his mother.[3][4][a] He then attended the D.A.V. Public School in Palampur, where he studied up to middle standard.[3] He received his senior secondary education at Central School, Palampur.[3][4]
Besides his academic excellence, Batra played sports and represented his school at the national level during the Youth Parliamentary competitions at Delhi. He represented his school and college in table tennis, Karate and other such games. In 1990, he and his twin brother represented their school in table tennis at All India KVS Nationals.[6][4][7][8] He also was a green belt holder in Karate and went on to attend a national level camp in Manali.[9]</p></div>
<div class="grid-item2"><h1>Military career</h1>
<p>Batra joined the Indian Military Academy (IMA) at Dehradun, in June 1996 in the Manekshaw Battalion.[20] After completing his 19-month training course, he graduated from the IMA on 6 December 1997 and was commissioned as a lieutenant into the Indian Army.[21] He was commissioned into the 13th battalion of the Jammu and Kashmir Rifles (13 JAK Rif). After commissioning, he was sent to Jabalpur, Madhya Pradesh for regimental training. The training lasted one month, from December 1997 to the end of January 1998.[22]
On completion of this training he got his first posting at Sopore in Baramulla district of Jammu and Kashmir, an area with significant militant activity.[22] In mid-March 1998, he was sent to the Infantry School at Mhow, Madhya Pradesh, where young Army officers are trained, for the Young Officer's Course. This training lasted five months until September 1998. Following completion of the course and being awarded alpha grading, he joined his battalion in Sopore in October 1998.[4][22]
During his posting in Sopore, Batra had several encounters with militants. In one of those encounters when Batra was leading an ambush with his platoon into an area of dense forest, he escaped when bullet fired by a militant grazed his shoulder and struck one of Batra's men behind him, who was killed. Believing that the bullet was meant for him and not his colleague, he ordered his men to fire on the militants, and by morning all of the militants were killed.[23][24] Batra, however, was saddened, because he knew that the bullet was meant for him. "Didi, it was meant for me and I lost my man," he had told his elder sister over the phone.[25]
In January 1999, Batra was sent on a Commando Course at Belgaum, Karnataka where he excelled. The course lasted for two months and at the end of it, he was awarded the highest grading â€” the Instructor's Grade.</p></div>

<p>Batra's battalion, the 13 Jammu and Kashmir Rifles (13 JAK Rif), reached Dras on 6 June, was placed under the command of 56 Mountain Brigade, and was given orders to act as reserves to the 2nd battalion of the Rajputana Rifles (2 Raj Rif) during their attack on Tololing mountain.[32] The 18th battalion of The Grenadiers (18 Grenadiers) first attacked Tololing on 22 May, but were unable to capture the peak.[34][35][36] 18 Grenadiers made four attempts to capture Tololing,[37][38] but could only succeed in securing the lower slopes,[39][40] while suffering heavy casualties.[38][41] Eventually, 2 Raj Rif was assigned the mission of capturing Tololing and they did so on 13 June 1999.[36]
After the capture of Tololing, 13 JAK Rif marched from Dras to Tololing, reaching their destination in 12 hours.[42] Upon reaching, Alpha company of 13 JAK Rif took over Tololing and a portion of the Hump Complex from 18 Grenadiers.</p></div>
